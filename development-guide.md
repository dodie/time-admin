Getting started
---------------

Timeadmin is based on the [Lift web framework](http://liftweb.net/) and the
[Simple Build Tool (SBT)](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
Various build tasks can be issued from the *SBT shell* (```./sbt``` or ```sbt.bat```
in the project root directory).

To start the application with an embedded HTTP server issue the ```container:start```
command in the *SBT prompt*. Timeadmin will be published to port 8080, and be available
until the shell is closed or the ```container:stop``` command is issued.

Before the start of the application, the dependency lookup and the compilation of the
modified sources will automatically happen. To trigger the compilation manually, issue
the ```compile``` command.


IDE Support, Interactive Console
--------------------------------

For IDE support, you can generate Eclipse project files with the ```eclipse``` command
in the *SBT shell*. To start an interactive Scala shell, enter ```console```. In this
console you can import Lift modules and your own code to experiment with. Booting the
Lift application is required if youâ€™re using core Lift infrastructures such as Mapper
or accessing property files:

```
scala> new bootstrap.liftweb.Boot().boot
```


Test suite
----------

Timeadmin has a multitude of automated tests. Unit tests (*test scope*) check functions
and independent classes or small clusters of classes without initializing Lift or accessing
the database. Integration tests (*it scope*) check whole services and modules, so these
tests are using the database and check parts of the rendering by running snippet code.
End-to-End (*e2e scope*) tests exercises the whole application through a real browser.

The tests can be started with the following goals in the SBT shell:

- To execute **all automated tests**, use ```test-all```.
- To execute **unit tests**, use ```test```.
- To execute **integration tests**, use ```it:test```.
- To execute **e2e tests**, use ```e2e:test```.


Packaging
---------
To build the WAR, use *clean compile package*. You can find the assembled package in the
target directory.


Running
-------
Issue the following command to create a WAR file:

```
./sbt clean compile package
```

You can deploy it to a standard Web container. Timeadmin is tested with the latest versions of Tomcat.


### Configuration

If necessary, you can supply custom configuration to your instance by setting the ```-DexternalConfig=<path>```
variable for the application. The default configuration file can be found in the 
[default.props](https://github.com/dodie/time-admin/blob/master/src/main/resources/props/default.props) file.

By default Timeadmin provides an in-memory HSQL database, but it can be configured to use a PostgreSQL instance
by providing the relevant settings in the properties file. For example:

```
db.driver = org.postgresql.Driver
db.url = jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/timeadmin
db.user = postgres
db.password = 1234
```

It also provides an opportunity to customize the Timesheet Excel template by providing its path via
the ```export.excel.timesheet_template``` key. To get you started, see
[this template](https://github.com/dodie/time-admin/blob/master/docs/exceltemplate/timesheet_template.xls) file. 

Timeadmin also has user management with password recovery. For this to work, an SMTP has to be configured.
See the following settings for an example:

```
mail.smtp.host = localhost
mail.smtp.port = 22
mail.smtp.auth = false
mail.smtp.user = user@domain
mail.smtp.pass = 1234
```


Application structure in nutshell
---------------------------------

- scala/bootstrap.liftweb.Boot:
Configures the Timeadmin, eg. sets DB access based on the configuration and initializes the sitemap and available URLs.
Responsible for defining authorization rules at the page level.
- scala/code.model._:
Data model classes. Timeadmin uses Schemifier.
- scala/code.service._:
Place of utilities, complex calculations, and data queries and derived data representation.
- scala/code.snippet._:
Snippets are rendering components that provide dynamic data on the pages. Most of the snippets are stateless.
- webapp/admin, webapp/client, webapp/index.html and freshuser.html:
Page templates. Defines layout and snippets for each page.
- webapp/templates-hidden:
Page base templates and common templates, localization files.

Authorization rules are defined at page and URL level granularity,
services and snippets generally do not check for further permissions.
