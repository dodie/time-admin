Getting started
---------------

Timeadmin is based on the [Lift web framework](http://liftweb.net/).

First, download SBT [Simple Build Tool (SBT) version 0.13.18](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).

Various build tasks can be issued from the *SBT shell*. To start that, run `sbt` in the
project root directory.

To start the application with an embedded HTTP server issue the ```container:start```
command in the *SBT prompt*. Timeadmin will be published to port 8080, and be available
until the shell is closed or the ```container:stop``` command is issued.

Before the start of the application, the dependency lookup and the compilation of the
modified sources will automatically happen. To trigger the compilation manually, issue
the ```compile``` command.


IDE Support, Interactive Console
--------------------------------

For IDE support, you can generate Eclipse project files with the ```eclipse``` command
in the *SBT shell*. To start an interactive Scala shell, enter ```console```. In this
console you can import Lift modules and your own code to experiment with. Booting the
Lift application is required if youâ€™re using core Lift infrastructures such as Mapper
or accessing property files:

```
scala> new bootstrap.liftweb.Boot().boot
```


Test suite
----------

Timeadmin has a multitude of automated tests. Unit tests (*test scope*) check functions
and independent classes or small clusters of classes without initializing Lift or accessing
the database. Integration tests (*it scope*) check whole services and modules, so these
tests are using the database and check parts of the rendering by running snippet code.
End-to-End (*e2e scope*) tests exercises the whole application through a real browser.

The tests can be started with the following goals in the SBT shell:

- To execute **all automated tests**, use ```test-all```.
- To execute **unit tests**, use ```test```.
- To execute **integration tests**, use ```it:test```.
- To execute **e2e tests**, use ```e2e:test```.


Packaging
---------
To build the WAR, use *clean compile package*. You can find the assembled package in the
target directory.


Running
-------
Issue the following command to create a WAR file:

```
sbt clean compile package
```

You can deploy it to a standard Web container. Timeadmin is tested with the latest
versions of Tomcat.


Application structure in nutshell
---------------------------------

- scala/bootstrap.liftweb.Boot:
Configures the Timeadmin, eg. sets DB access based on the configuration and initializes the
sitemap and available URLs. Responsible for defining authorization rules at the page level.
- scala/code.model._:
Data model classes. Timeadmin uses Schemifier.
- scala/code.service._:
Place of utilities, complex calculations, and data queries and derived data representation.
- scala/code.snippet._:
Snippets are rendering components that provide dynamic data on the pages. Most of the
snippets are stateless.
- webapp/admin, webapp/client, webapp/index.html and freshuser.html:
Page templates. Defines layout and snippets for each page.
- webapp/templates-hidden:
Page base templates and common templates, localization files.

Authorization rules are defined at page and URL level granularity,
services and snippets generally do not check for further permissions.
