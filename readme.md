*Timeadmin* is a simple web-based tool for time tracking to measure the time spent
on various tasks by collaborators working on small or large projects.
From the collected data the tool can generate reports, such as
timeline of activities in a given day, or monthly summaries.

It can generate monthly **timesheets** from the collected data, that can be personalized with
an Excel template.

The **collected data** can provide insights about the time spent by the team.
